# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/detayans/Linear-Regression-Project/blob/main/Project_linear_Regression.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**47%** accuracy](https://github.com/detayans/Linear-Regression-Project/blob/main/Project_linear_Regression.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** To explore Bank's marketing compaign and create meaningful insight on the data.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [*91%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/detayans/Logistic-Regression-Project/blob/main/ProjectLogisticReg.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify the client will subscribe the term deposit.
- Encode catagorical data to numeric.
- Splitted the train test dataset and trained the model.
- Explored a machine learning approach to market analyse.

<img src="images/Bio.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, KNN, NB

**Project Objective:** To predict normal and abnormal status of patient based on orthopedic parameters using KNN and NB algorithm. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the data with KNN algorithm to attain a accuracy of [82.8%] (https://github.com/detayans/KNN-NB-project/blob/main/Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb).

- Prepared the data for training
- Trained the data with KNN algorithm
- Trained the data with Naive Bayes algorithm
- Compared the values for best algorithm

<img src="images/talkingdata.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Bagging ,Boosting

**Project Objective:**To predict the probabiltity of click being genuine or fraud based on given features using boosting and bagging technique.

**Quantifiable result:** We got the accuracy of [**96.8%**](https://github.com/detayans/Bagging-and-Boosting-Project/blob/main/ProjectBagging%26Boosting.ipynb).

- Cleaned data
- Applied bagging classifier
- Apllied gradient boostclassifier model
- Calculated the accuracy of all the models

[Identifying the hand written digits from MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/detayans/Hand_writting_recognition_project/blob/main/Hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb)
keras?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow, MNIST

**Project Objective:** We are going to employ the keras based python deep learning framework that readily offers complex mathematical layers that compute and form weights that are resultant of the data the model is viewing and learning from and then predict on new dataset.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**99.20%** using **10** epochs](https://github.com/detayans/Hand_writting_recognition_project/blob/main/Hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given MNIST data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided hand written digits.
- Data Source: MNIST
